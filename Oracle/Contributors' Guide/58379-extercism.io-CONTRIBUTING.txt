# Contributing to Exercism.io

First of all, **thank you** for helping with Exercism.io!

## Issues

Please file issues on the [GitHub issues
list](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues) and give as much detail
as possible.

## Features

This is a prototype, and as such we're quite open to feature experiments. If
you want a feature implemented, the best way to get it done is to submit a
pull request that implements it. Tests would be wonderful.

There are full instructions on getting the app running [in the
README](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/blob/master/README.md).

Please read and abide by the [Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please try and stick to the [GitHub Ruby Style
Guidelines](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, sometimes we'll ask you to make changes before
we accept the patch.

Please do not close the first pull request and open a second one with these
changes. If you push more commits to a branch that you've opened a pull
request for, it automatically updates the pull request. This is also the case
if you change the history (rebase, squash, amend), and use git push --force to
update the branch on your fork. The pull request points to that branch, not to
specific commits.

## Languages and Practice Problems

If you'd like to

* fix inconsistencies in READMEs or test suites
* improve existing problems in existing language tracks
* contribute new problems in existing language tracks
* contribute problems in a new language track

then please see the [Problem API's CONTRIBUTING

Thank you again!
